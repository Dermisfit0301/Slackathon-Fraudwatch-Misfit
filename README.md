# slackathon-for-simplilearn-Payment-Fraud-Detection
This repository has been created for a competition called a slackathon. We are given an imaginary business problem and we have to figure out a way to solve that problem.
I chose the topic of Payment Fraud Detection. I will be collecting data from various sources and would build an algorithm or you can say a layout to detect Payment frauds and block them. 
NOTE: This is just a model or a layout, not the real program with practical usage.

**Project objective **

The objective here is to come up with the algorithm that detects a fraudulent transaction.

**Short description of the project**

We are going to use past details of credit card transactions in order to see the patterns that leads to a fraudulent transaction. The patterns thus identified will help us form insights into the data and we will know which group of customers are more vulnerable and many more such facts. Tableau will be used to slice and dice the data which will help us understand the dataset through graphic vizualizations. 
*We will include the file here.*
The identified patterns and insights will help us create a model which we will train through machine learning methods which will help us determine a fraudulent transactions. The trained machine will be implemented on the testing dataset which will help us know the effectiveness of the model.

**What's the problem we are dealing with?**

Nowadays we live in a world that is now a global village. The era of technology has made the whole whorld a small digital village. You can get food, clothes and even a wife from the internet. There is a voluminous rise of internet commerce and hence transactions made online are increasing by the minute everyday. This has caught the eyes of the criminals who have gone online as well and are trying to get a piece of the pie. 
Fraudulent transactions are made by these criminals after they steal your credentials usually through fake apps, dating accounts etc. These are the transactions someone else makes and we end up paying for it. 
Fraudulent transctions not only harm the customer but also the company as they are the ones who face the music. They have to deploy manpower to track it and to handle customers which leads to loss of not only time and energy but also reputation. 

How can technology help?

Optimize supply chain inventory - Technology to optimize supply chain inventory and to help quickly choose the best manufacturing plants to optimize inventory and minimize cost.

The idea

Using historical demand data to train a machine learning model, you can predict demand for certain items more accurately in the future, and ensure that your customers are able to purchase what they want.

Using this predicted demand as input, along with manufacturing plant data such as cost and capacity, this application enables a store manager to quickly choose the best manufacturing plants to optimize inventory and minimize cost.
