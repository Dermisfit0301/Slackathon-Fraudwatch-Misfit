# slackathon-for-simplilearn-Payment-Fraud-Detection
This repository has been created for a competition called a slackathon. We are given an imaginary business problem and we have to figure out a way to solve that problem.

I chose the topic of Payment Fraud Detection. I will be collecting data from various sources and would build an algorithm or you can say a layout to detect Payment frauds and block them. 

NOTE: This is just a model or a layout, not the real program with practical usage.

### **Project objective**

The objective here is to come up with an algorithm that detects a fraudulent transaction.

### **Short description of the project**
The fraudulent transactions are the one that are not made by the card owners but by scammers. The objective of the algorithm is to catch such transactions.
We are going to use past details of credit card transactions in order to see the patterns that leads to a fraudulent transaction. The patterns thus identified will help us form insights into the data and we will know which group of customers are more vulnerable and many more such facts. Tableau will be used to slice and dice the data which will help us understand the dataset through graphic vizualizations. 
*We will include the file here.*
The identified patterns and insights will help us create a model which we will train through machine learning methods which will help us determine a fraudulent transactions. The trained machine will be implemented on the testing dataset which will help us know the effectiveness of the model.

### **What is the problem we are dealing with?**

Nowadays we live in a world that is now a global village. The era of technology has made the whole whorld a small digital village. You can get food, clothes and even a wife from the internet. There is a voluminous rise of internet commerce and hence transactions made online are increasing by the minute everyday. This has caught the eyes of the criminals who have gone online as well and are trying to get a piece of the pie. 
Fraudulent transactions are made by these criminals after they steal your credentials usually through fake apps, dating accounts etc. These are the transactions someone else makes and we end up paying for it. 
Fraudulent transctions not only harm the customer but also the company as they are the ones who face the music. They have to deploy manpower to track it and to handle customers which leads to loss of not only time and energy but also reputation. 

### **How can technology help?**

Technology can play a role in preventing such transactions by calling out such fraudulent transactions. Machine learning when deployed properly can take into account patterns that lead to a fraud transaction and notify the bank to cancel the transaction. ML can identify user spending habits, location, time of spending etc and can easily identify if the transaction was legitimate or not. 
The historical data of the users can be used to create a machine learning model and create an algortithm that can detect such frauds. The machine learning model will use classifier techniques to predict fraud transactions. Classifier techniques is to be used as they will tell whether a payment is fraud or not. 


### **Why I chose this topic?**

Machine Learning has a variety of applications and this application where I can use this to detect a fraudulent transaction seems intriguing as well as interesting. 
I think this topic needs to be addressed as I myself have been a victim of a fraudulent transaction and I had to pay for credit card transactions which I didnt make. This is a personal reason why I chose to do this topic. Now if I talk about the professional reason, I found this topic to be a playground for using Machine Learning techniques. You can use both supervised and unsupervised techniques for this topic either to draw insights or to create an algorithm. I can use clustering to create groups of customers who are more likely to face a fraud or use PCA to find important components affecting the transactions. The possibility is endless and I am bit to find out what it holds.

### **The structure**

1.The transaction details are generated by the bank and are stored as a repository.

2.Then they are fed line by line to the program.

3.The program looks at patterns of fraud.

4.When the fraud is detected from the pattern the transaction is cancelled.

5.A notification is generated and sent to the bank. 



### **Long description**

**Algorithm creation**

Here I will summarize the whole process of creating my algorithm from scratch. I will cover every point in brief. 

**1.Dataset obtaining**

I had obtained the dataset from Kaggle. It had around 150000 transactions and was divided into two parts. I merged the two datasets into one and used the new dataset for analysis. I mounted the dataset in Google colaboratory as it was more convenient and easy to use than Jupyter Notebook which crashes. 

**2.Dataset description**

It had the following columns.

**trans_date_trans_time**: The date and time of the transaction.

**cc_num**: credit card number. 

**merchant**: Merchant who was getting paid.

**category**: In what area does that merchant deal.

**amt**: Amount of money in American Dollars. 

**first**: first name of the card holder.

**last**: last name of the card holder.

**gender**: Gender of the cardholder.Just male and female!

**street**:Street of card holder residence

**city**:city of card holder residence

**state**:state of card holder residence

**zip**:ZIP code of card holder residence

**lat**:latitude of card holder

**long**:longitude of card holder

**city_pop**:Population of the city

**job**:trade of the card holder

**dob**:Date of birth of the card holder

**trans_num**: Transaction ID

**unix_time**: Unix time which is the time calculated since 1970 to today.

**merch_lat**: latitude of the merchant

**merch_long**:longitude of the merchant

**is_fraud**: Whether the transaction is fraud(1) or not(0)




**3.Packages used**

Pandas used for data analysis and manipulation

Numpy for mathematical formulae and stuff like that.

Seaborn for data visualization

Matplotlib will help us visualize the data.

Scipy for statistical functions.

Sklearn package will help us with Machine learning 

Ipywidgets for plotting.

Date time package is for date and time operations. 

Xgboost gives us their classifier.

**4.Data cleaning/organizing**

**5.Feature engineering** 

Here I created new variables like Age using date of birth.
I split the trans date and time into two seperate columns like transaction date and transaction time. 
I created bins to categorize time of the incident and age groups. 
I removed the unnecessary columns that hamper analysis. 


**6.Exploratory data analysis** 

**5.Model building**

**6.Basic Algorithm**

*Note:I am not a professional developer or a programmer. This is just a basic hackathon submission. Therefore i dont have any idea which application I would use for integration and further development of Fraudwatch. The basic algorithm is provided*
