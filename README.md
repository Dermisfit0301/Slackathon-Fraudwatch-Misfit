# slackathon-for-simplilearn-Payment-Fraud-Detection
This repository has been created for a competition called a slackathon. We are given an imaginary business problem and we have to figure out a way to solve that problem.
I chose the topic of Payment Fraud Detection. I will be collecting data from various sources and would build an algorithm or you can say a layout to detect Payment frauds and block them. 
NOTE: This is just a model or a layout, not the real program with practical usage.

What's the problem?

Optimize Supply Chain Inventory Super Effectively manage and optimize inventory by capturing variables such as lead times, manufac- turing frequency, batch size, and ordering policies from across the supply chain. Using algo- rithms, exception-based forecasts, and real-time downstream demand signals, suggest and adjust inventories to optimal levels. Maintain the right amount of inventory required to meet demand, keep logistics costs low, and avoid common inventory issues such as stockouts, over- stocking, and backorders.

How can technology help?

Optimize supply chain inventory - Technology to optimize supply chain inventory and to help quickly choose the best manufacturing plants to optimize inventory and minimize cost.

The idea

Using historical demand data to train a machine learning model, you can predict demand for certain items more accurately in the future, and ensure that your customers are able to purchase what they want.

Using this predicted demand as input, along with manufacturing plant data such as cost and capacity, this application enables a store manager to quickly choose the best manufacturing plants to optimize inventory and minimize cost.
